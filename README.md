# ng-firebase-chat
A basic firebase chat application with registration and login component using **google firebase and angular 1.5** library. Also integrating angular2 components as well.

Also **SingleSingOn with google and facebook accounts is enabled**.

**npm install** and
-> run **gulp**

We were using google firebase for login authentication and registrations as well. For this we gonna use angularfire node module.

Also, you have to create an account and project in google firebase to access firebase backend in your project.

Please find the screenshots in screenshots folder to work with firebase.

#Firechat enabled
You can chat with your friends once you logged in through email/google/facebook account.

#Integrated Angular2 Components
Also, I am trying to integrate angular2 in this project. Hence i added a footer component currently which is being rendered on our application.
